# Windows vs Linux File System

Windows focuses on:
- Ease of use
- GUI-based management
- Centralized control

Linux focuses on:
- Simplicity
- Transparency
- Command-line power

Windows uses ACL-based permissions.
Linux uses ownership and mode bits.

Neither is better universally.
Each is designed for different environments.
