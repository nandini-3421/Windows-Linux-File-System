# Windows Permissions and Ownership

In Windows, every file and folder has:
- An owner
- A permission list (ACL)

The owner controls who can access the file.

Permissions define:
- Who can read
- Who can write
- Who can modify
- Who has full control

Permissions are inherited from parent folders
unless inheritance is disabled.

Important rule:
Deny permissions always override Allow permissions.

Understanding ownership is critical
for troubleshooting access denied issues.
