# Linux Directory Structure Explained

Linux has a standard directory structure.

Some important directories:
/bin   → Essential commands
/etc   → Configuration files
/home  → User home directories
/var   → Logs and variable data
/tmp   → Temporary files
/root  → Root user home directory

Each directory has a specific purpose.
This consistency allows administrators
to manage any Linux system easily.

Once you understand this structure,
Linux becomes much less confusing.
