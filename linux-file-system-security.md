# Linux File System Security

Linux file system security relies on:
- Permissions
- Ownership
- User privileges

The root user has full control,
but Linux encourages minimal root usage.

Security features include:
- SELinux
- AppArmor
- Immutable files

Linux systems are secure by default,
but misconfigurations can still create risks.
