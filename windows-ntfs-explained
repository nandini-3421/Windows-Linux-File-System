# NTFS (New Technology File System)

NTFS is the default file system used by modern Windows systems.

NTFS was designed for:
- Security
- Reliability
- Large storage support

Key features of NTFS:
- File and folder permissions
- File ownership
- Encryption (EFS)
- Compression
- Journaling (crash recovery)

NTFS keeps track of changes using a journal.
If the system crashes, NTFS can recover
without corrupting the entire disk.

This makes NTFS very reliable for enterprise systems.
