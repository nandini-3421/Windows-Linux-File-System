# Windows File System Security

Windows file system security is based on:
- NTFS permissions
- User accounts
- Groups
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Windows integrates file permissions with:
- Active Directory
- Group Policy
- Auditing

This allows administrators to:
- Control access centrally
- Track file access
- Detect unauthorized activity

This tight integration makes Windows
suitable for large enterprise environments.
