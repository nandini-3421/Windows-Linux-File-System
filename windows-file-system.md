# Windows File System Overview

Windows uses drive letters to represent storage devices.

Examples:
- C:\ → System drive
- D:\ → Secondary drive
- E:\ → USB drive

Windows primarily uses the **NTFS** file system.

The Windows file system is designed to:
- Be user-friendly
- Support graphical access
- Integrate with Active Directory
- Enforce permissions using ACLs

Windows hides many system files by default
to protect users from accidental damage.
