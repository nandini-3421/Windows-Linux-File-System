# Linux File System Types

Linux supports many file systems.

Common ones include:
- ext4 → Most widely used
- xfs → High-performance
- vfat → USB compatibility
- swap → Virtual memory

Linux allows different file systems
to be mounted anywhere in the directory tree.

This flexibility is one of Linux’s biggest strengths.
