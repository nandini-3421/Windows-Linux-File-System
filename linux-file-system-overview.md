# Linux File System Overview

Linux follows a very different approach compared to Windows.

Linux does NOT use drive letters.
Everything starts from a single root directory: /

All files, devices, and storage
are part of one unified directory tree.

In Linux:
- Everything is treated as a file
- Even hardware devices are represented as files

This design gives Linux:
- Simplicity
- Flexibility
- Strong control
