# Introduction to File Systems

A file system is the method an operating system uses
to store, organize, and manage files on a storage device.

Without a file system:
- The OS would not know where a file starts
- Data would be unorganized
- Files could overwrite each other

A file system answers basic questions:
- Where is the file stored?
- Who owns the file?
- Who can read or modify it?
- How much space does it use?

Both Windows and Linux use file systems,
but their design philosophy is very different.
