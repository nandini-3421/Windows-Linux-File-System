# Linux File Permissions Explained

Linux uses a simple but powerful permission model.

Each file has:
- Owner
- Group
- Others

Each category has permissions:
- Read (r)
- Write (w)
- Execute (x)

Permissions are displayed as:
rwxr-xr--

Linux permissions are strict by design.
If permissions are wrong,
even the admin must explicitly fix them.

This model gives Linux strong security
with minimal complexity.
